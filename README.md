# Beyond the Bedside: Evaluating Hospital Quality of Care amidst Workforce Shortages

## How does the shortage of healthcare professionals in certain regions of the U.S. impact the quality of care provided in acute care hospitals?

### The Rationale

My last job before DATA was as a certified nurse assistant (CNA) at a private hospital that was recently acquired by a larger hospital network.  Working at this hospital was a transformative experience, and really made me sensitive to how factors like staffing and cultural competence (especially in areas with diverse patient populations) can affect quality of care.

I worked on a Med/Surg unit where we had weekly huddles to discuss how our unit (and the hospital) was performing in terms of patients falls, infection control, patient satisfaction, etc.  On the job, I was hypersensitive to the importance of infection control, especially for surgical patients, to prevent issues like surgical site infections, CAUTIs, and spread of C. diff.  I have a clear understanding of most of the sub-measures that comprise each of the five quality of care domain groups.

I'm also very interested in this topic area because during the time when I contemplated going to medical school, it was always my dream to apply to residency programs in regions of the country with the highest need for medical doctors.

### The Audience

One potential audience = Executives at hospitals operating in shortage areas, who are incentivized by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program to identify areas for improvement at their hospitals.  (The CMS rewards hospitals with payments based on quality of care, as assessed by measures related to five domains: mortality, safety, readmission, patient experience, and timely & effective care.)

Second potential audience = Early-career healthcare professionals (e.g. physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) transitioning from training to practice, who are seeking to identify high-need regions and hospitals that could benefit from additional workforce.

### The Questions

1) Which states/counties in the U.S. are facing the most severe shortages of healthcare professionals?  (I will look at HPSA Score.)

2) Which states/counties have the lowest quality of care metrics within their hospitals?  (I will look at Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating first, then I can drill down to the five domain measures.)

3) How do the quality of care metrics compare between hospitals in regions classified as shortage areas versus those that are not?  How have quality of care measures changed over the years in shortage areas compared to non-shortage areas?

### The Expectations

I expect that rural areas in the U.S. might have the most severe shortages of healthcare professionals, while urban areas might have less.  I also expect that areas with a greater percent of their population below the federal poverty level might have a greater need for practitioners.

I also expect that the hospitals with the lowest quality of care metrics might be located in regions classified as health professional shortage areas.  I have no strong expectations about which of the five measure groups (mortality, safety, readmission, patient experience, timely & effective care) might have the lowest scores.

For hospitals in both shortage areas and non-shortage areas, I think that I might see evidence of lower quality of care scores during 2020 due to the pandemic, with potentially higher scores in 2022-2023.
